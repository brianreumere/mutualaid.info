<img id="joey" alt="Joey in the movie Hackers, hacking the Gibson in a dark room. His mouth is slightly open like he's thinking, &quot;whoa&quot;. A CRT monitor displays a list of files. The interface is bright green and there is random text, maybe listings of other directories, floating in the background. Third from the bottom in the file list is the notorious garbage file. In the background, behind the monitor, purple light filters through window blinds." src="images/joey.jpg">
