I've designed a couple of mechanical keyboard PCBs (printed circuit boards) that are open source. The design files (for [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/)), bills of materials, documentation, etc. are [on the htpkbs GitHub](https://github.com/htpkbs/) {{< fa "github" >}}.

## pin-check

Inspired by the utility of the [Postage Board](https://github.com/LifeIsOnTheWire/Postage-Board) and the aesthetics of the [plaid keyboard](https://github.com/hsgw/plaid), the [pin-check](https://github.com/htpkbs/pin-check) is a small PCB that uses all through-hole components and is intended to be used as a controller for hand-wired keyboard builds. [There are some build photos here](https://imgur.com/a/NQUPJTM).

## orch

The [orch](https://github.com/htpkbs/orch) is a mostly [ortholinear](https://www.reviewgeek.com/70291/what-is-an-ortholinear-keyboard-and-should-you-use-one/) 4-row (plus an arrow key cluster and function key column) keyboard PCB that should fit most GMK keycap sets.
