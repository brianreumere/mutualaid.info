This is a somewhat comprehensive list of data brokers, sourced from the <a href="https://github.com/brianreumere/data-brokers" target="_blank">data-brokers repo on GitHub</a> {{< icon "github" >}}. See the full post (link TBD) for context.

**It is highly recommended to use at least a private or incognito browser window when visiting any of the links below**. A VPN (<a href="https://protonvpn.com/" target="_blank">ProtonVPN</a> is a good free option) or <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/" target="_blank">Tor Browser</a> is even better (though you may face more captchas than you would otherwise).

You can [download a CSV of all data brokers here]({{< ref "databrokers.md" "databrokerscsv" >}}).
